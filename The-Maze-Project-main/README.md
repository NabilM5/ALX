# The Maze

The Maze is a 3D Maze game that utilizes ray casting to transform a 2D map into a 3D navigable environment!

The project was developed in C using the SDL2 library. Development was conducted on Ubuntu 24.04 using GCC (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.3.0.

### About SDL2 

Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2) is a cross-platform development library that provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware through OpenGL and Direct3D. SDL2 is widely used in video playback software, emulators, and popular games, including many titles from Valve and Humble Bundle games.

## Installation 
To clone the repository, run:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NabilM5/The-Maze-Project.git
```

## Usage 
- Run the game by typing `./maze` or `make run` in the terminal.
- Use the up and down arrow keys (or the W and S keys) to move forward and backward.
- Use the left and right arrow keys (or the A and D keys) to rotate the camera.

## Compilation
To compile the code, use the following command:
```sh
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic ./src/*.c -lm -o maze `sdl2-config --cflags` `sdl2-config --libs`;
```
